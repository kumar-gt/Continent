# Continent
**Problem**  Write a program that creates a travel plan where you visit every continent from a given origin city and back using the shortest distance traveled.   There are 6 continents to be visited (excluding Antarctica) so you should create a plan where you visit 6 cities (including the origin) in any order. The trip should start and end at the origin city which will be the input of the program. The distance between the two cities can be calculated using the formula given in the first [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27943/1986034) to this question. The cities.json file attached below has all the cities, their geolocation (latitude, longitude), and the continent they belong to (param name: contId).
